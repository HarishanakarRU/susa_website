        <p> SUSA is partnering with the <a href='http://sgsa.berkeley.edu'> Statistics Graduate Student Association (SGSA) </a> to provide exciting opportunities to the undergraduates in the statistics community! </p>

	<h2> Overview </h2>
        <p> In Fall 2020, we offered two ways to get involved in our program: mentorship and office hours. </p>
        <h3> Mentorship </h3>
        <p> Undergraduates had the chance to be paired up with a graduate student mentor to form a personal and professional relationship. Paired mentees will meet with their mentors monthly to discuss their goals and gain insights into graduate school and career related matters. </p>
        <h3> Office Hours </h3>
        <p> Our graduate students hosted weekly office hours to answer any questions you may have about graduate school in statistics or anything else that you would want to talk about. Get to know various graduate students other than your GSI's through these office hours and use them to your advantage to get more perspectives on your plan in life! </p>
	<p>The office hours happened on:</p>
